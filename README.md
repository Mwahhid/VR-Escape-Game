A virtual reality escape game where you are trapped in a post-apocalyptic bunker and your goal is to find the key and escape without getting caught by a wandering zombie.

Implemented AI script in C# for the zombie to detect the player when in range, follow the player once detected, avoid all obstacles in path, go look around for the player if the player successfully hides.
